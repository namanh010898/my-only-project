# Daihoc_FPT_News
(Why did we develop the website?)
Officially established on September 8, 2006 under the Prime Minister's decision, FPT University quickly became one of the top universities in Vietnam. To help parents, students who are interested about FPT University to easily access information needed, the FPTNews site was born. Thit web site provides all information surrounding FPT University.

(The users)
The FPTNews site creates for 3 types of users: the administrator, the contact teams and end users which interest FPT University. 

(The constraints)
The FPTNews site connects directly to https://daihoc.fpt.edu.vn to get posts online. This is a benefit for administrators not to upload pages many times but also a weak one, it requires the parent site host to always run to get the post.

(Why do you need to register an account?)
The difference of having an account on The FPTNews site brings many advantages to users. An Authorised system access account will give you access to many supported features from the website such as: taking surveys, registering for events, advanced documents.
